<h4 class="post-title">About</h4>
I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.
For the Spring 2020 semester, I'm a Teaching Assistant for <a href="http://berkeley-cs186.github.io" target="_blank">CS w186</a>,
an Introduction to Database Systems. Previously, I've been involved with <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su19/" target="_blank">CS 61C</a>
(Machine Architecture) and <a href="https://cs88-website.github.io" target="_blank">CS 88</a> (Python + Data Science). I'm also working on
systems projects with UC Berkeley's <a href="http://bets.cs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">BETS</a> group within RISELab.

The past couple summers, I've had the fortune of working with some wonderful individuals at Make School
