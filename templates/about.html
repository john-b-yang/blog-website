<h4 class="post-title">About</h4>
Thanks for checking out my page! My name's John and I'm currently an undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Outside of classes, I'm a huge Lakers fan and Star Wars nerd.
<br><br>
I recently became a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://cs88-website.github.io" target="_blank">CS88</a>, a lower division undergraduate course that delves into Python fundamentals in the context of data science. I'm also a Vice President within UC Berkeley's <a href="https://vcg.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Valley Consulting Group</a>, a student run organization that collaborates with big tech names on a wide variety of projects. Last but not least, I'm a research assistant with <a href="http://bets.cs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's BETS</a> group within RISELab. I assist graduate students with research that rethinks the scale and efficiency of tools for solving today's building, energy, and transportation challenges.
<br><br>
In the past couple summers, I've had the fortune of working with some wonderful individuals at <a href="http://makeschool.com" target="_blank">Make School (YC W12)</a> as an iOS Games Instructor and at Apple ï£¿ under the AppleCare iOS division as a Software Engineering Intern. At Make School, I taught seventy-five students the fundamentals of iOS development and guided five special students to succesfully ship their own gaming applications to the App Store! At Apple, I developed software tools for interfacing with and diagnosing potential hardware issues with the iOS product line, specifically the iPhone. This past summer 2018, I headed over to Mountain View to intern at Google. I worked on Google Assistant <img style="margin-bottom:-2px" src="/static/pictures/Projects/GAssistant.png" height=20/>, specifically their iOS platform! I had a chance to dabble in mobile app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/the-google-assistant-app-will-walk-you-through-your-day/" target="_blank">design</a>, Mac app development, compiler design, and iOS <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/" target="_blank">SDK</a> creation.
<br><br>
I'm interested in the general realms of Artifical Intelligence, Operating Systems, and Machine Architecture. Specifically, I enjoy projects that discuss how we can make the physical world around us smarter. As you can probably guess, I also very much enjoy iOS and web development, too! In addition, I'm passionate about how technology can impact education and communication in the near future.
