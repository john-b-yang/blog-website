This past semester as a student at UC Berkeley, I took a computer science course titled "CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture". This course servers as a primer for the C programming language. It dives into the so called "low level" machine structures that hosts the nitty gritty details of "what" and "how" a computer works.

CS61C is known for having a handful of long projects. Personally, the challenge for doing well on these assignments were two fold. First, the implementation for these solutions were very lengthy. Second, due to the lack of scaffolding, it became common for work in progress to start veering in the wrong direction.

To be honest, I felt pretty overwhelmed when faced with a task that is characterized by this dangerous degree of freedom. Too many times, I found myself spending hours writing an implementation from scratch to completion, only to find out that it was the incorrect approach.
