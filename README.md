This is the source code for my personal blog. Check it out to see some of the technical blog posts that I've written. It uses a Flask backend to perform URL routing, and all the front end is just pure HTML/CSS with Jinja2 templating. The entire architecture is hosted with Github (formerly Heroku). If you're interested in using this template, simply download the repository. Edit the "pages" folder to write your own new blog posts using Markdown files. For more styling related edits, look into the "static" folder for CSS, Javascript, and extra assets such as pictures. Last but not least, to design and change the style or organization of your own webpages, edit the "template" folder.

I wrote a longer technical blog post that dives into the above process in much greater detail. Check it out [here](http://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/)
